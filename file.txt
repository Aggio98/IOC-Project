=== Incident Report — Preliminary Notes ===

At 03:14 UTC, multiple authentication attempts were detected from host 192.168.1.44.
However, further logs show a connection from 256.14.22.5 — this is probably a malformed IP.

The phishing email referenced a domain: secure-update-login.com
—but another weird one appeared in chat logs: paypa1-verification.net
(Jury is still out on whether it's a typo or intentional.)

Contact reported receiving an email from: support@my-company.org
But also "notify@@service...com" which is clearly invalid.

--- Log Snippet ---
[WARN] Failed login for user admin from 10.0.4.23 at 2025-11-29T07:21:03Z
[INFO] DNS query: intranet.local returned NXDOMAIN
[DEBUG] Possible C2 traffic to hxxp://malware-control-panel.biz (defanged)

Random bytes: af39f112-9c2d-4b71 :: NOTE: ignore test@example,com and 33.44.55.666

We also saw these during packet capture:
- suspicious-domain: backup-data-sync.co
- maybe? danger..zone
- IP candidates: 172.20.10.5, 98.12.300.20, 45.77.88.101

TODO: investigate email "john.doe@operations" (missing TLD)
Analyst note: marketing.team@company.co.uk seems legitimate.
